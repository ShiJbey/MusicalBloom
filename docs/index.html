<h1>Musical Bloom</h1>
<div id="author">by: Shi Johnson-Bey (ishmaelj)</div>
<p>A clone of the simple simon game, but cubes will play sounds and "illuminate" using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_(shader_effect)">bloom shader</a>.</p>
<!-- the <div> wrapping this image centers it on the page. -->
<!-- TODO: drawing showing the main view of the game during play -->
<div class="figure">
<img src="game.jpg" width="400px" height="400px"/>
</div>
<p>Players have to copy the sequence of cube illuminations previously played by the computer. If they, get it
	right, then the sequence is expanded by one value. If not then game over.
</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>Keyboard keys are mapped to the different cubes pictured on the screen. After the game plays a sequence of sounds,
	the player repeats the pattern back by pressing the keys that correspond to the correct cubes. This process repeats until
	the player loses.
